       "  'content': 'This place used to be called Chicken Bonz, as they specialized in chicken wings and had a few other items on the side.  They were pretty good and I ate there all the time.  \\n\\nUsed to being the important part.  \\n\\nA few months ago they broke from the franchise and renamed Meat Chix and Wieners.  Really?  Who calls a restaurant this?  I tried it out a few times after the change but today was the last straw.  We walked in and ordered the usual, 6 WIngs medium for me, same for my wife, Ranch and Blue Cheese dip, large fries to share and two drinks.  Well they changed their menu and no longer have medium sauce or Blue Cheese.  What kind of wing place doesn\\'t have Blue Cheese.  My wife changes her order to a Portabello burger with onion rings, hot sauce on the side.  Almost $25 dollars later we sit down to wait.  \\n\\nAnd wait...and wait some more.  \\n\\n25 minutes later we get our order. Did I mention this is a cook to order fast-food place.  Orders used to come out at lightning speed, sometimes before we had even filled our drinks and sat down.  Not anymore. We were assured several times that our food would be right out by who we think was the manager.  However she grabbed her bags from the office that was set up in a booth in the corner of the restaurant before we got our food.\\n\\nAfter all that waiting you think they could at least get the order correct, right? Nope.  My wife got her burger with their trendy version of french fries that look like little more than thick potato chips.  No hot sauce, no onion rings.  I get my 5 1/2 wings (one was a mutant or from a baby chicken) , ranch and no fries.  She goes to cashier (the only person no working outside of the kitchen BTW)  and let her know.  A few minutes later we get the onion rings, but no sauce or apology.  \\n\\nThe food itself was OK, but again used to be much better.  The wings were small and thinly sauced.  The order of \"fries\"  was small and not particularly good.  My wife did say the Portabello burger was good.  \\n\\nI really wish I didn\\'t have to write this, since the previous establishment had been so good and we went there often.  Whatever changed in the past few months has certainly been a bad move on Meat Chix and Wiener\\'s part, and I don\\'t think they\\'ll be seeing us again.',\n",

What kind of wing place doesn\\'t have Blue Cheese. My wife changes her order to a Portabello burger with onion rings, hot sauce on the side. 25 minutes later we get our order. Did I mention this is a cook to order fast - food place. Orders used to come out at lightning speed, sometimes before we had even filled our drinks and sat down. We were assured several times that our food would be right out by who we think was the manager. My wife got her burger with their trendy version of french fries that look like little more than thick potato chips. No hot sauce, no onion rings. ( one was a mutant or from a baby chicken), ranch and no fries. the only person no working outside of the kitchen BTW)   and let her know. A few minutes later we get the onion rings, but no sauce or apology. The food itself was OK, but again used to be much better. The wings were small and thinly sauced. The order of \" fries \"   was small and not particularly good. My wife did say the Portabello burger was good. I really wish I didn\\'t have to write this, since the previous establishment had been so good')]"

It\\'s what real estate agents would call \"cozy\" or \"charming\" - basically any euphemism for small.\\n\\nThat being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:\\n\\n* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.\\n* it\\'s not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don\\'t bring them.\\n* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to \"just look around\" and \"do whatever.\" \\n\\nAt such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.'"
